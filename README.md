Shift record keeper

I dont like to keep the paper that has the print out of how many hours i worked and when it started , when its ended and all. So I created a system where i just have to enter the details i got from the punching machine and it will make an excel file for me every 15 days with all the details required and could be used to double check the amount i received.
